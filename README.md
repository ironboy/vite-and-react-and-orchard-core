This is a Vite with React + TS + Orcchard Core as backend project.

To start up, the first time:

1. Run **npm install**.
2. Run **npm start** and wait for .NET/Nuget-packages to install
3. Stop (Ctrl+C) both servers
4. Copy the database from backend/db_template/OchardCore.db to backend/App_Data/Sites/OrchardCore.db

Now (and for all following startups if no new databasechanges from your team mates), start up using:

**npm start**.
